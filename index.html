                Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the
                Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history.
                Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons
                mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates
                striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when
                you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle,
                death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to
                “fragile” humans...
              </p>
              <!-- They incinerate them. With fewer dragons
                willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better
                their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for
                being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most
                powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. She’ll
                need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next
                sunrise. Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows
                more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the
                death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to
                suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret. Friends,
                enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an
                agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:
                graduate or die -->

                Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days. The last
                time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked
                her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal.
                As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares.
                The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a
                17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food
                is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the
                wrong color...
              </p>
              <!-- The Reestablishment said their way was the only way
                to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many
                people are dead that the survivors are whispering war—and The
                Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more
                than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she's
                exactly what they need right now. Juliette has to make a choice:
                Be a weapon. Or be a warrior. -->

                A legendary competition. A mesmerizing romance. An unbreakable
                bond between two sisters. Scarlett Dragna has never left the
                tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their
                powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged
                a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing
                Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience
                participates in the show—are over. But this year, Scarlett’s
                long-dreamt-of...
              </p>
              <!-- invitation finally arrives. With the help of a
                mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only,
                as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s
                mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s
                Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is
                the winner. Scarlett has been told that everything that happens
                during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless
                she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.
                And whether Caraval is real or not, Scarlett must find Tella
                before the five nights of the game are over or a dangerous
                domino effect of consequences will be set off, and her beloved
                sister will disappear forever. Welcome, welcome to Caraval . . .
                beware of getting swept too far away. -->
